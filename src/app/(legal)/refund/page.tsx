            <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 25th July 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
                At Talxify, we offer specialized, AI-powered digital services. Due to the nature of our subscription-based model and the immediate access to our tools and features upon purchase, we maintain a strict no-refund policy.
            </p>

            <h2>2. No Refunds</h2>
            <p>
                All purchases are final and non-refundable. We do not issue refunds for any subscription fees, including monthly or yearly plans, regardless of whether the service was used or not. There are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Try Before You Commit</h2>
            <p>
                We understand that you may want to evaluate our services before committing to a longer-term plan. For this reason, we offer a monthly subscription option with a lower entry cost. We encourage new users to select a monthly plan to experience the full range of Talxify's features before considering a longer-term subscription.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
            <p>
                You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. When you cancel, you will continue to have access to all paid features until the end of your current billing cycle. You will not be charged for any subsequent cycles.
            </p>
